Rewrite the Student_info structure to calculate the grades immediately and store only the final grade.

My solution:
===========

-following files were adjusted/edited:

Student_info.h and Student_info.cc:
-----------------------------------
-function "read_hw" was removed and its content and functionality was moved into function "read"
-"std::vector<double> homework" variable (vector) was removed according to exercise description
-"double grade" variable was declared to hold the whole grade for student

grade.h and grade.cc:
---------------------
-function "grade(const Student_info&)" was removed as its functionality was performed within read function -> directly reading homework grades into vector
