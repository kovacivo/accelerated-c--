// Write a program that will keep track of grades for several students at once. The
// program could keep two vectors in sync: The first should hold the student's names,
// and the second the final grades that can be computed as input is read. For now, you
// should assume a fixed number of homework grades. We'll see in ยง4.1.3/56 how to
// handle a variable number of grades intermixed with student names.
// input: student names put into vector
// input: student grades for every student put into another vector
// output: printing result for every student
