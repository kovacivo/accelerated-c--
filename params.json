{"name":"Accelerated-Cplusplus","tagline":"My repo for doing the exercises from book Accelerated C++","body":"### Welcome to my Accelerated C++ repo pages.\r\nHere I will put all my solutions to exercises in the book Accelerated C++ as well as programs within individual chapters. This will help me to get experience and knowledge on programming.\r\n\r\n#### Theory and exercises\r\nIn my repo for each chapter I divided the content into two different folders: theory and exercises to easily distinguish the programs during text from the exercises.\r\n\r\n### Your support and contributions\r\nYour support and help is welcome. Feel free to check my solutions possibly letting me know of the possible mistakes I did in my programs or on whatever could be done better.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can mail me @ivan.kovac216@gmail.com or find my repo(@kovacivo) on GitHub.","google":"UA-45945239-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
